# DSA-lab

Data Structures and Algorithms lab repository

## Grading

There will be 2 laboratory tests, one about Data Structures and one about Algorithms.

Each test will count as 35% from the final LAB_GRADE.
The remaning 30% will be calculated based on your input during the semester (Pull Requests with what you've worked and ACTIVITY_POINTS based on how active you are during lab sessions).

LAB_GRADE is 35% out of the final grade.

Each lab will have proposed problems which you will have to solve and upload it on git.

* There will be "extra credit" assignments that can only be completed by those who already have completed the "normal" assignments. These will be even more thoroughly inspected and evaluated.
